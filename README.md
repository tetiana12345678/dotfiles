# dotfiles

This is the configuration I use. 
If something goes wrong and I lose those dotfiles I would be very-very sad, cry a little bit and then spend a day
or maybe more, or less if I am lucky to have it all back.

If you want to use all or part of this configuration - you are very welcome to do so,
as far if you give smiles to people around you.
